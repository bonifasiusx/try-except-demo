# Try-Except Demo in Python

This repository contains a collection of simple examples demonstrating how to use `try-except` blocks in Python. The code explores how exception handling works, when to use it, and what can go wrong if it's misused.

## Purpose

This project was built as part of the **Portofolio Build** assignment in the Data Science Bootcamp at **Purwadhika Digital Technology School**. It aims to reinforce the importance of proper error handling in real-world programs.
